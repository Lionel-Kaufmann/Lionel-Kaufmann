## About Me

### My Background

Since 2015, I’ve been supporting small businesses (1 to 5 employees), family-owned firms, and domiciliary companies (with no operational activities) in their financial management, governance, and regulatory compliance needs. After completing a degree in Business Economics (HES-SO) with a specialization in Controlling and NPV (Net Present Value), I developed additional skills in accounting, taxation, and corporate law.

Over the years, I’ve held various mandates as a director and legal representative, continuously refining my knowledge through complementary training (finance, Swiss and international tax, etc.). Today, I put my expertise at your service, wherever you are located.

### My Values

- **Transparency:** I favor clear communication, along with documented and easy-to-follow processes.
- **Professionalism:** Every step is methodically planned—from business creation to tax returns—to ensure quality and compliance.
- **Adaptability:** I tailor my approach to your industry and the size of your company, using modern tools and a flexible workstyle.
- **Closeness:** Through digital collaboration, I remain reachable and responsive (video calls, secure messaging), offering personalized support at all times.

### My Methodology

**Preliminary Analysis:**  
I review your situation, goals, and constraints (deadlines, budget, specific industry factors). This step helps me pinpoint your main challenges and propose targeted solutions.

**Customized Action Plan:**  
Based on the initial analysis, I draft a detailed roadmap (key priorities, timelines, recommended tools) which we validate together.

**Implementation & Follow-Up:**  
I handle the setup and configuration of essential tools (bookkeeping, HR, domiciliation, etc.), collaborating closely with your team or working in an outsourced model. You’ll receive regular progress reports to keep track of results.

**Ongoing Evolution & Sustainability:**  
My focus is on building reliable, scalable processes. I stay available for future adjustments, strategic advice, or any needs that arise (inspections, audits, bylaw amendments, etc.).

### My Commitment

As an external CFO and business management expert, I aim to:

- Relieve you of time-consuming administrative and financial tasks.
- Optimize your costs and workflows, boosting profitability.
- Guarantee full compliance (tax, legal, FINMA requirements, etc.).
- Guide you in strategic decision-making through accurate financial data and hands-on advice.
